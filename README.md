# MDPA
Solution for PA session 1
Changes include addition of InitEStream.m, AddElipAtomicArray, and AddCurtainStream
AddElipStream uses a lower hald semi-circle as the array of particles
InitEStream uses the curtain stream
CAddCurtainStream adds a sweeping stream of particles from left to right
The particles in the curtain stream will be evenly spaced between set points
These set points are specific to the Elip array.
The number of particles in the stream can be changed, and the stream will evenly space the particles
